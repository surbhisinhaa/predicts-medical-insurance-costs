# predicts-medical-insurance-costs
This project predicts medical insurance costs using Machine Learning techniques.
The notebook (insurance.ipynb) explores the dataset, performs data preprocessing, visualization, and builds models to estimate insurance charges based on features like age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region.

Key steps included:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Data preprocessing (handling categorical & numerical features)

Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Performance evaluation with accuracy metrics
